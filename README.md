### software/website that searches all patent db at once
- prevents having to search all patent db indiviually
- doesn't exist
- good for research/students

#### Concerns
Europian Patent Office provides similar service



### a basic 2d game engine for platformers (e.g. celeste, mario bros)

baseline:
- physics engine with variable parameters like gravity, speed, etc
- api style egine
- no extra GUI or application

extension:
- could be extended for rogue likes (dead cells)
- could be extended to 2.5d (moonlighter, stardew valley)
- implement economy
- GUI

target audience
- platformer devs, indie devs and the like

#### Concerns
- potentially huge scope
- needs to be taylored for a subgenre of games (e.g. Platformers, dungeon crawler)



### financial education guide
- a customizable platform for financial education
- gamified simulator (taxes, bills, savings, etc.)
- help disseminate approved information by financial institutions and gov'ts
- develop alongside gov'ts and sell to school districts, etc.

#### Concerns
- a lot of knowledge of the problem domain needed
- make a smaller prototype to demonstrate basic functionalities/ 2-3 layers of imformation
- economy professors for input



### "Small jobs" platform
- Everybody with an account can post small jobs (cutting grass, shopping, walking dogs, etc.).
- Others can "apply" for a job and do them.
- Get paid via the app. (We have some revenue as commission.)
- Target audience: old people and grown-ups as "sellers" and students as "workers".

#### Concerns / Comments

- Freely choose jobs at first

- Expand to give recommendations for matches

### smart vending machines platform
- Saving favorite orders (e.g. preferred coffee, products, and combinations)
- Mobile and card payments
- Order and collect orders
- Dynamic pricing (combo deals)
- Customer incentives to encourage sales and location loyalty
- More precise business intelligence (e.g. which products sell more, at what frequency)
- Stocking recommendations based on what customers get in other locations

#### Concerns
- does this involve certain vending machine
- can this be changed/modified to be broader & remove the hardware factor



### Maths exercises for small children
- I have a nephew and I made a small website for him to create a "Maths maze". You have to find the way out by solving the additions and substractions. The path is the even results. You can reach it here: http://backup.nhely.hu/matyi/
- So, my idea is something like that. We can make different small games as well. Include multiplication, long divisions.
- Easy-to-use website to help parents print the exercises.
- It is easy on the internet to find exercises but they are "fixed". So if your child solves them you have to find a new source. This way you can generate as many as you want.
- Teachers can use it as well.

#### Concerns/Comments
- 3 games with different levels of math
- they are generated when chosen by user


### Desktop application that allows you to write Maths fluently
- Perhaps a window that could be pulled up the the side of a word document which would allow the user to draw symbols and have them converted to a format that could work on word.
- This would include a list of frequently used symbols that would copy to clipboard at a click.
- The idea is that a student could effectively take notes digitally without a stylus, touch screen machine, or pen and paper.
- Lecturers and teachers could purchase along side student and people working in the field.


#### Concerns/Comments
- LaTeX generator?
- exists as a website
