## new stuff
Questions for Bruce:
- Is the scope of the game engine suitable for this project, how much would we actually need to do to demonstrate?
- What do we do when legal problems show up (e.g. in the small jobs app), how realistic do our ideas need to be?

5votes

baseline:
- physics engine with variable parameters like gravity, speed, etc
- api style egine
- no extra GUI or application

- could be extended to 2.5d (moonlighter, stardew valley)
- implement economy
- GUI

target audience
- platformer devs, indie devs and the like

#### Baseline Project - Phsysics Engine
Focuses on:
- Dynamics
- Collisions

### "Small jobs" platform
4votes
- Everybody with an account can post small jobs (cutting grass, shopping, walking dogs, etc.).
- Others can "apply" for a job and do them.
- Get paid via the app. (We have some revenue as commission.)
- Target audience: old people and grown-ups as "sellers" and students as "workers".

#### Concerns / Comments
- Tinder but for odd jobs
- Freely choose jobs at first

- Expand to give recommendations for matches

### financial education guide
3votes
- a customizable platform for financial education
- gamified simulator (taxes, bills, savings, etc.)
- help disseminate approved information by financial institutions and gov'ts
- develop alongside gov'ts and sell to school districts, etc.

#### Concerns
- a lot of knowledge of the problem domain needed
- make a smaller prototype to demonstrate basic functionalities/ 2-3 layers of imformation
- economy professors for input

#### Basic prototype
- create jobs
- accpet jobs
- reject jobs
- cancel jobs

### Maths exercises for small children
3votes
- I have a nephew and I made a small website for him to create a "Maths maze". You have to find the way out by solving the additions and substractions. The path is the even results. You can reach it here: http://backup.nhely.hu/matyi/
- So, my idea is something like that. We can make different small games as well. Include multiplication, long divisions.
- Easy-to-use website to help parents print the exercises.
- It is easy on the internet to find exercises but they are "fixed". So if your child solves them you have to find a new source. This way you can generate as many as you want.
- Teachers can use it as well.

#### Concerns/Comments
- 3 games with different levels of math
- they are generated when chosen by user
