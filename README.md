### "Small jobs" platform - TaskRabbit is almost the same
4votes
- Everybody with an account can post small jobs (cutting grass, shopping, walking dogs, etc.).
- Others can "apply" for a job and do them.
- Get paid via the app. (We have some revenue as commission.)
- Target audience: old people and grown-ups as "sellers" and students as "workers".

#### Concerns / Comments
- Tinder but for odd jobs
- Freely choose jobs at first
