### Android App development

- Java and Kotlin (Kotlin is much better than Java and if you know a little bit of Java, it is easy to learn. And developing an app with Kotlin is much faster now.)
- I have some predefined "solutions" for Android apps which we can use.
- Basic android tutorial: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp
- Kotlin docs (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- Jetpack Compose (This is the faster way now: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial)

### Others

- Some website skills: JS, Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/), PHP as backend
- Firebase (You can use it as database, crash report tool, file storage for users) https://firebase.google.com/ - You can use it on web and Android, iOS as well.
- Gimp for design
- Python
- Learnt C# in secondary school

## Kieron

- I've never worked on an app or produced anything usable outside of projects for school/university. I'm not fully familiar with the process but I believe I have useful skills anyhow.


- Python is my strongest language. We've had to use it a lot for the courses.
- Basic is the language that I started programming on. It's pretty much dead and I wouldn't recommend using it but I thought I would list it anyway.
- HTML: I built simple websites when I was younger. I'm sure most people know html but I enjoyed it.
- Java: as much as I needed to know for the previous courses. I like the language though and would happily work with it or similar (Kotlin as suggested)
- Databases: I was made to do a ton of database work at school, with access and excel. I believe we need a database for the project and I'm confident I could build a nice one.
- Photoshop: I've used it a decent amount. I'm happy to attempt design challenges and the like.

## Roman

- Java (Maven)
- Python
- Assembler ARM

- I have worked in a team on a big project before, although that was a hardware project w/ waterfall management (1 year long)
