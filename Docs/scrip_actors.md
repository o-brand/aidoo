# Actors in our Scrip System

There is probably some overlap in real actors between 1 & 2.

- can this be disregarded?

Are there any actors missing and need to be added?

## 1 - people mainly posting jobs

These people are in need of help and mostly unable or unwilling to fulfill requests themselves.
They do not really care about the store and the items therein.

- might not have enough scrip to pot a job when they need to 


## 2 - people mainly doing jobs

These people do jobs to help others or to purchase something from the store.
They occaisonally post jobs that they need completed.
These people shoud have enough scrip to post a request.

- usually have enough scrip for what they need to do
- goal is the get stuff from the store

## 3 - charities

Charities never use the store, the can only post jobs. These jobs are generated by them or people send in requests to them (not in the app).
Charities might put stuff up in the store to be purchased by other users.

- no purchasing from store
- where do credits to post something come from if they don't complete jobs
