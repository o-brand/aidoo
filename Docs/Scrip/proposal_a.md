# Scrip Proposal A

The task of designing a scrip system is not an easy one. There are many choices to make and many gray areas and questions with each decision. Our intention in creating Aidoo is to help the broadest set of people and work with different segments of the community.

In most of these systems, it is assumed that everyone is able to contribute at some capacity. We have not disregarded this assumption entirely, but our vision for Aidoo to be an inclusive space takes precedence over it. This decision introduces some weaknesses into our scrip system but is inseparable from our mission.

Our primary challenges in designing the system consisted of the following guiding questions:
1. How can we prevent the alienation of users whose ability to volunteer is limited?
2. How can we ensure that the system is in equilibrium, i.e. the average amount of money per user remains constant?

We propose the following principles for our system as answers to the questions above.

## 1. Gifting and charity sponsorship
Charities and volunteers can directly sponsor users who mostly post jobs. We believe this feature will allow greater inclusion for users who cannot volunteer as much as others (e.g. in the cases of disabilities). Additionally, we think that this feature can help cement Aidoo as an actor in the local community by the company's work with local charities, and by enabling members to get to know each other better.

## 2. Starting balance
Every new user starts with a given amount of money. This step guarantees that the amount of money in circulation increases as new users join the platform and that the economy can be bootstrapped by the first generation of users.
Users may use this money freely, but this will likely not be sufficient to purchase any rewards.

We intend to prevent sybil attacks by requiring users to undergo identity verification before they can use the platform and retaining these credentials for a legally-permitted period in the case of user deletion and re-uptake. While in practice some sybilling is still possible by means of identity theft or fraud, these would be extreme examples. As such, our work is founded on the assumption that our system is not affected by sybils.

## 3. Aidoo Guardians
This program enables the team to achieve several goals regarding the scrip system and the economy. It allows for a stream of jobs that can be done by anyone who has some basic experience with the website and a device with internet connection. These jobs could be biased toward users of a certain age or those who mostly post jobs rather than participate as volunteers.
