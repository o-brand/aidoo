assumed that the userbase is very similar and all participate

## strategy & rules

issue with scrip on signing up:

making new accounts for scrip -> no worry with ID verification

issue: everyone has to contribute

solution? 
1: everybody MUST contribute (in some way)

2: some ppl may not be able to 
- how to facilitate their participation?
- first batch must give some users some scrip, scrip/person in balance -> give them allowance on signup 
- enough for them to participate in econ -> enough to post small job (walk dog or smth) not enough to buy significate reward


issue: Amount of srcip in sys is strictly decreasing

potentially diverse userbase -> how to accommodate?
2 users -> resentment/ game the sys

gifting tokens possible? -> rand or targeted
if rand -> seen as tax? (criteria for extra token)

Suggestion:

gifiting to specific person or charity

charities (other orgs) are already in community & helping them

give spent tokens:
to charity -> sponsors redirect tokens into other ppl creating jobs (facilitate the cycle)

1. make rules (write down the rules: diagram good start -> turn into a set of choices)
2. play through rounds
3. adjust depending on how tokens change in system

Tokens: give right to take a reward, but are not used to pay for reward



## Chatting

why: not all comms through email

what: starting the base (rooms)


## set up shop

why: no shop no scrip cycle
