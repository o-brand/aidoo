# Small Jobs App Ideas

## Brief (working) overview:
A website/web app that gets people within an organization or community to perform tasks in exchange for points. These points behave like a digital currency in an "incentive shop" managed by the organizers.

### Use cases:
   - In an office to make daily operations smoother (e.g. coffee runs/brewing, replacing water in cooler, etc.)
   - By a town council to get people volunteering in a local capacity
   - In a school to incentivize students (cleaning boards, participating in certain extracurricular activities, etc.)

## Principal components:
- Portal for task posters
- Portal for bidders
- Incentive shop
- Databases
   - User management/permissions
   - App data (tasks, bids, etc.)
   - \+
- Ranking algorithms
   - Sorting
      + Parameters: value, how long a task been posted, urgency, etc.
