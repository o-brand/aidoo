  <h1 class="mb-4">Community guidelines</h1>
  <h4>Rule 1</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Be respectful to others in the language you use. This is a platform that enables and incentivizes helping each other.
  Nurturing a welcoming environment is part of that.</p>
  <h4>Rule 2</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Please be respectful and aware of others. We are all humans and make mistakes.
  Sometimes things happen that are out of our control.
  Everyone, regardless of their background, deserves not to be harassed.</p>
  <h4>Rule 3</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Respect other people&#39;s privacy. Doxxing and/or revealing others&#39; personal details strictly violates the terms of use.</p>
  <h4>Rule 4</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual content.</p>
  <h4>Rule 5</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">If you know you cannot do a job you accepted, let the poster know and withdraw from the job.</p>
  <h4>Rule 6</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Do not try to exploit the reward system. This website was built to encourage and incentivize helping each other, not to gain free stuff.</p>
  <h4>Rule 7</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Keep it legal. The posting or discussion of content discussing or depicting illegal actions or items is prohibited.</p>
