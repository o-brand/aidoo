# Game Ideas

## Dragons & Knights platformer

2d (maybe metroidvania) platformer where you are the dragon.
Could also be an RPG, but probably out of scope.

You were caputred & emprisoned by a kingdom. 

### variant 1
You have to escape fighting bosses and such. Try not stealing the princess on the way.


### variant 2
sneek out of the castle and escape without being spotted.


## Snakes and Ladders Mathematics Game for young children
- Plays a game of snakes and ladders, when the player lands on a snake or a ladder they are given an equation. (Addition / Subtraction) up to 20.
- Getting the answer correct results in a positive outcome (avoid snake, climb ladder), getting the answer wrong results in a negative outcome (descend snake, do not climb ladder).
- The board can be randomly generated for desired size and density of snakes and ladders.
- The equations are easily randomised.
- In the case of a printable version we would need a function that would print a list of equations and answers that could be cut into small pieces and put face down on the table (monopoly chance style).
- We can implement a function that colours each snake / ladder differently so that they are easily distinguishable.
