#Research

## Migration:
	- pythonanywhere cannot be used
	- if pythonanywhere is no be used support mySQL
	
	switch away from pythonanywhere, due to separation issues

## Chat:
	- a lot of examples are available -> tut and lib are avaible on github
		1. use lib and see how customisable
		2. implement ourselves -> (Gabor: it should be relatively easy)

		room creation problem with lib as well
		
	- most of these tuts just create groupchats

## React & Frameworks:
	Issues:
	- loose a lot of django functionallity -> cant use models anymore (serializer needed)
	
	Recommended to not use framework when possible, use bootstrap and javascript [might be enough, prevents having to shift]
	
	How would affect longevity?
	Long term benefits?
	
	*Might not be smart due to time constraints*

## Frontend - Backend Communication;
	Node.js ?
	Pro: 
	- lots of example projects

	Con:
	- unfamiliar frameaork
	
	HTMX ?
	- need to change response & request patterns
	- required data validation in backend
	- message is HTML -> changes the HTML of the page itself to disable stuff

	Pro:
	- reduce use of javascript

	Explaination

## Scrip
	mostly inspo from 3 papers

	need to get scrip in circulation, to optimize.
	need to prize items in shop in terms of hours per perchuse.
	scrip sharing?

	scrip for validation and violation detection
	
	- pricing in hours

	biding for a job? -> reduces control of monetary currency

# Changes:
	- hosting, because of separation not possible
	decouple it for the code

	website hosting: current platform more and more limiting, github pipeline
	maybe using heroku

	database: currently not separated from the code

	- frontend framework
	makes developing, less messy & easier to maintain
	easier and less repeatative, reuse of code -> could ruin the models

	! might make models useless

	otherwise use javascript and bootstrap
